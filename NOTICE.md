# Notices

This package is an independent ComfyUI companion for:

- Open-H3-Regenerate-2K-IC, NVlabs/Sana `sol-engine`
  https://github.com/NVlabs/Sana/tree/sol-engine/models/Open-H3-Regenerate-2K/IC
- Weights: Efficient-Large-Model/Open-H3-Regenerate-2K-IC
  https://huggingface.co/Efficient-Large-Model/Open-H3-Regenerate-2K-IC

`assets/silence_audio_124f.safetensors` is copied from the official
Open-H3-Regenerate-2K-IC weights repository (`assets/silence_audio_124f.safetensors`)
so the target audio rows match the official sampler exactly. Model weights and
derivative assets remain subject to the MiniMax-H3 Community License and the
upstream notices, not the license of this node code.

MiniMax-H3 is a MiniMax model. Open-H3-Regenerate-2K-IC is not an official
MiniMax product.

The LoRA conversion script is derived from the tensor-layout mappings documented
by the upstream project and ComfyUI's MiniMax-H3 loader conventions.
